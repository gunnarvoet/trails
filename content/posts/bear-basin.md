Five days mostly off-trail in the High Sierras. Starting from Pine Creek trailhead north-west of Bishop we ascended into Granite Park, crossed over to Royce Lakes, into Bear Basin, over to Vee Lake, back into Bear Basin and looped around Italy Pass. Excellent views and at times difficult but still manageable terrain.
