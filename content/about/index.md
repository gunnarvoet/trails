Small collection of photos taken along hiking trails, mostly in Southern California.

If you plan on hiking around San Diego, make sure to grab a copy of Jerry Schad's [Afoot and Afield: San Diego County](https://www.wildernesspress.com/product.php?productid=16509) and bring plenty of water on the trail.

I have also found the [US Topo Maps app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atlogis.northamerica.free&hl=en_US) for Android phones to be invaluable for any type of day hike. Unless I go for a several day backpacking trip where I still like to bring a real map, a charged phone and pre-downloaded maps on this app work breezingly. Make sure to buy the pro version of the app if you use it more often to support the developers, they have done an outstanding job. GPS tracks shown on this site have been recorded with this app.
